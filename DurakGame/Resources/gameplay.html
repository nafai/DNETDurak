    <h1>Attack:</h1>
    <p>The attacker plays any card in their hand (face up).</p>
    <p>After the attack, if the defending card is trups the first card placed (the attack), the attacker may place another card in an attempt to trump the defender's card. However the second attack is limited to cards that are already on the table. </p>
    <br/>
    <h1>Defense:</h1>
