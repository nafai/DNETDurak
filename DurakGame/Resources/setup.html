-------------------------------------------------------------------------------->




    <h1>Setting Up</h1>
    <p>Durak is played with 36 card deck, containing all face cards as well as the sixes through tens. Alternatively, the game can also be played with a 20 card deck, if not the basic 52 cards.</p>

    <p>The game is recommended for four players (two teams of two), however it can be played with anywhere from two to six people.</p>

    <p>The cards are first dealt by the dealer. If there has already been a round, the dealer is traditionaly the loser to the previous game.  Cards are delt, hand by hand, to each attacker first then to the defender when the attackers have their cards. Cards are delt untill all players have a hand of six cards.</p>

    <p>The remainder of the deck is set face down to be drawn from. Additionaly one card is placed face up and sideways on the bottom of the deck. This card represents the trump suit (strongest suit that beats all others).)</p>
