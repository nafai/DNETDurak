        <h1>Tutorial</h1>
        <p> Durak has no winners. Each player is dealt a certain number of cards based on the deck size. There are attackers and defenders. </p>
        <p> Attackers must look at the card on the playing field and see if they have a card in their hand which is of the same face value but higher number and play that card on the field. </p>
        <p> The person on the right of the attacker is the defender, the defender looks at the top card on the playing field and must put down a card of the same suit but higher value or a trump card. If the defender cannot put down a card then they must pick up all the cards on the playing field and put it into their hand.  </p>
        <p> If the defender was successful in stopping all of the attacks then the defender becomes the new attacker, otherwise the person to the right of the defender is the new attacker. </p>
